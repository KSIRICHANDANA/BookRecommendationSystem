# BookRecommendationSystem
The Machine Learning Book Recommender System is a multifaceted project aimed at revolutionizing the way readers discover books. Leveraging data from books, users, and ratings datasets, the project preprocesses and integrates this information for analysis. It provides two core functionalities: first, it offers a curated list of the top 50 books through popularity-based ranking, and second, it delivers personalized recommendations using collaborative filtering. With a user-friendly web interface powered by Flask, users can effortlessly explore popular books and receive personalized suggestions. This project showcases data preprocessing techniques, collaborative filtering, and the deployment of an intuitive web application. Ultimately, it addresses the modern challenge of book discovery, enhancing the reading experience, and highlighting the practical applications of machine learning in recommendation systems.
